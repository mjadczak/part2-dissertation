\section*{Original aims of the project}

To implement a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for the construction of Apache Beam-compatible Pipelines, as well as an interface to the Java codebase allowing for the execution of these Pipelines using existing Beam software.

\section*{Work completed}

A DSL was implemented which required significantly less code to express concepts than the Java API.
It also adopted standard Elixir idioms.
A full Beam-like runner was also implemented in Elixir, instead of interfacing with a Java runner.

The runner implemented can execute computation Pipelines expressed in the DSL and contains a subset of features of Beam.
It displays superior performance under load in terms of resource usage, throughput and latency when compared against the local Beam Java runner.

\section*{Special difficulties}

None.
